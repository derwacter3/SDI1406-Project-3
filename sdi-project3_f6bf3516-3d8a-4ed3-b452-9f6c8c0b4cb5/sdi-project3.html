<p>The theme of this project is about a basketball game that I have been thinking about. The game will be in text base for now but hope to incorporate more in the future. The reason I picked this theme is because I'm a huge basketball fan. Also I would like to create a basketball game one day with my own twist on it. The last reason for picking this theme is because I think it fits into all the coding needed done.</p>
